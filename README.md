# Cube-Satellite-Attitiude-Control

<h1>Project Overview</h1>
A brief, high-level summary of the repository's purpose. Explain what a CubeSat Attitude Control System is and why this project exists. For example:

This repository contains the flight software and simulation environment for a CubeSat's Attitude Control System (ACS). The primary goal of this project is to provide robust and reliable software for determining and controlling the satellite's orientation in space.  The system uses various sensors and actuators to maintain a stable attitude, enabling mission objectives like Earth imaging, communication, or scientific data collection.


<h1>Features</h1>
List the key capabilities of your ACS software in a clear, bulleted format.

Attitude Determination: Algorithms for calculating the satellite's orientation using sensor data (e.g., TRIAD, QUEST).

Attitude Control: A set of control laws to command actuators to correct the satellite's attitude (e.g., PID controllers).

Sensor Integration: Support for common sensors like magnetometers, Sun sensors, and gyroscopes.

Actuator Support: Drivers and control logic for actuators such as magnetorquers and reaction wheels.

Simulation Environment: A high-fidelity simulation to test and validate algorithms without hardware.
